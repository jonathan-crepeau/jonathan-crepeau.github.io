            <p><span class="large-name">Jonathan</span> is an engaging full-stack web developer with several years
            experience in K-12 education, client service and higher education
            management verticals. Their inquisitive approach to learning —
            where they pursue a broad level understanding of a given topic
            alongside mastering practical execution skills — led to several
            achievements in their early career and a successful transition into
            software engineering. While Jonathan always keeps an eye on
            time management and technical efficiency, they are happiest when their
            technical work allows them to analyze, research and build intuitive systems that meet the exact needs of their employer and end users alike. They excel at building lasting relationships and seeks a work environment that will utilize their technical skills as well as the strong
            communication, collaboration and strategic abilities that define their
            working style and process.</p>
